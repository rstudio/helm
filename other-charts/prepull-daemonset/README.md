# prepull-daemonset

![Version: 0.0.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.3-informational?style=flat-square)

#### _a daemonset to prepull images so they are cached_

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` at version 0.0.3:

```bash
helm repo add rstudio https://helm.rstudio.com
helm install my-release rstudio/prepull-daemonset --version=0.0.3
```

## Use

Create a `values.yaml` file somewhere that lists the images you'd like to be pre-pulled (use the `values.yaml` file in this repo for format):

```
images:
  - name: my-first-image
    image: some-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-ecr-repo:latest
  - name: my-second-image
    image: some-id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-other-repo:latest
  - name: my-third-public-image
    image: ubuntu:bionic
```

## Pull Again

To run the pre-pull again (i.e. to pull new images with the same tag, to ensure node
caches<sup>†</sup> are fresh), there are a few options:

```
# by default, every upgrade is randomized / does a rollout (`--set randomize=false` to disable this behavior)
helm upgrade install prepull-daemonset rstudio/prepull-daemonset

# or use kubectl
kubectl rollout restart daemonset/prepull-daemonset
```

> <sup>†</sup> Kubernetes Nodes (specifically, the `kubelet` service) periodically remove images from
> the node's cache to free up disk space, especially if an image is not in use and has
> not been used lately
