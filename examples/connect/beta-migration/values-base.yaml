  # -- Optional. The runtime.yaml definition of Kubernetes runtime containers. Defaults to "base", which pulls in the default
  # runtime.yaml file. If changing this value, be careful to include the images that you have already used. If set to "pro", will
  # pull in the "pro" versions of the default runtime images (i.e. including the pro drivers at the cost of a larger image).
  # Starting with Connect v2023.05.0, this configuration is used to bootstrap the initial set of execution environments
  # the first time the server starts. If any execution environments already exist in the database, these values are ignored;
  # execution environments are not created or modified during subsequent restarts.

  # Additional images to append to the end of the "launcher.customRuntimeYaml" (in the "images" key).
  # If `customRuntimeYaml` is a "map", then "additionalRuntimeImages" will only be used if it is a "list".
  # Bootstraps the previous default set of "base" bionic images with "exact" matching. This means they can still
  # be selected explicitly by the publisher.
