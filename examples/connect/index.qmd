The examples in this directory provide a starting point for deploying Posit Connect in different configurations. 

Each example has a beginning description and a series of `TODO` comments.
Before using an example, read through all the comments and ensure you address each `TODO`.

While each example focuses on one or more particular configurations, Posit Connect has some
standard requirements listed in each example. Each example will need the following to run correctly:

- PostgreSQL database specified in the Connect configuration
- License key or file specified
- `sharedStorage` configured
