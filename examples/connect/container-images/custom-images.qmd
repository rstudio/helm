# Configuring Posit Connect with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Connect using custom images instead of the default public Posit provided images.

Connect requires a minimum of three images to function in Off-Host Execution mode. The following list shows the default public repositories:

- Connect service container [rstudio/rstudio-connect](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-connect)
- Content container [rstudio/content-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/content-base)
- Content init container [rstudio/rstudio-connect-content-init](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-connect-content-init)

Connect lists several content containers as execution environments by default on initial startup based on the [default-runtime.yaml](https://github.com/rstudio/helm/blob/main/charts/rstudio-connect/default-runtime.yaml) file. Setting `customRuntimeYaml` will instead use the execution environments defined in that section instead of the default ones. Additional content containers may be added to provide more R, Python and Quarto versions and other system dependencies. See the [Content Execution Environment](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/off-host/execution-environments/) section in the Connect Admin Guide for more details.
