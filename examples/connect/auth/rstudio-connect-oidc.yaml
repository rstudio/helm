# This example deploys RStudio Connect using OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO for
# authentication.
#
# Users will be authenticated via SSO (using OIDC) and users will be created
# in Connect upon first login or creation via the Connect API using certain
# claims received from the IdP.
#
# The focus of this example is on authentication configuration, however there
# are a few requirements to run Connect.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.


# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-connect#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-connect#license-key
