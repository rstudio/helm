# Configuring Posit Connect with an NFS-backed `PersistentVolume`

This example deploys Posit Connect with a single `PersistentVolume` backed by an NFS server.

The `PersistentVolume` allows setting NFS `mountOptions` and it creates a `StorageClass` that Posit Connect then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup) due to the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain` setting.

```
