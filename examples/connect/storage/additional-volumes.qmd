# Configuring Posit Connect with additional volumes

This example shows how to mount a `ConfigMap` to the Connect pod and a `PVC` is mounted to content pods.
This pattern of specifying the volumes and volumeMounts will work for a variety of volume types: `PVC`, `ConfigMap`, etc.

Depending on the need to add additional volumes, you may only need to mount to the Connect service or content pods but not both. 
For example, if you need to add TLS certificates for Connect via a `ConfigMap` then the content pods do not need the `ConfigMap` mounted.
