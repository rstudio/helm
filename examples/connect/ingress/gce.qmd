# Configuring Posit Connect with a GKE Ingress

This example deploys Posit Connect with an Ingress using the GKE Ingress Controller to create a GCP Application Load Balancer.
This example shows how to set annotations to enable session affinity, redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and use GCP Certificate Manager if desired.

The GKE Ingress Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation. Please visit the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress) for more details specific to your use case.
