# Configuring Posit Workbench with additional volumes

This example shows how to mount a `ConfigMap` to the Workbench pod and a `PVC` is mounted to session pods.
This pattern of specifying the volumes and volumeMounts will work for a variety of volume types: `PVC`, `ConfigMap`, etc.

Depending on the need to add additional volumes, you may only need to mount to the Workbench service or session pods but not both. 
For example, if you need to add TLS certificates for Workbench via a `ConfigMap` then the session pods do not need the `ConfigMap` mounted.
