# Configuring Posit Workbench with an NFS-backed `PersistentVolume`

This example deploys Posit Workbench with a single `PersistentVolume` backed by an NFS server.

The `PersistentVolume` allows setting NFS `mountOptions` and it creates a `StorageClass` that Posit Workbench then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

`sharedStorage` is not needed in this example as `config.server.rserver.conf.server-shared-storage-path` is set to put the required shared storage folder in `/home`

Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup) due to the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain` setting.
