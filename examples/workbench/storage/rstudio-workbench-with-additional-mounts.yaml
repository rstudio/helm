# This example deploys RStudio Workbench with additional mounts
#
# This example shows how to mount an additional PVC to the Workbench and 
# the session pods. This pattern of specifying the volumes and volumeMounts
# will work for a variety of volume types PVC, ConfigMap, etc. Depending on the
# need to add additional volumes, you may only need to mount to Workbench or
# session pods but not both. For example, if you need to add TLS certificates
# for Workbench then the session pods do not need the volumes.
#
#
# The focus of this example is on setting up additional mounts, however there
# are a few requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for homeStorage and userStorage
# and a PostgreSQL database.

# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key

  create: true
  mount: true
  storageClassName: nfs-sc-rwx # TODO: Change to a RWX StorageClass available in your cluster
  # volumeName: wb-home-pv-name # Only needed if PVs have been statically provisioned, in which case this will need to match the PV name.
