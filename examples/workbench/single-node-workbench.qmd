# RStudio Workbench with a Single Node and `sssd`

This example deploys RStudio Workbench with a single node. `strategy` and `replicas` are set accordingly, and this setup
should work even if using a `ReadWriteOnce` storage class. NOTE that the SQLite database will reside on the `sharedStorage`
persistent volume claim.

- Set `replicas: 1`
- Set strategy to `Recreate` so that the pod is stopped before starting another
- Create separate `homeStorage` and `sharedStorage` PVCs
- Configure `sssd` to point at an example domain and connect to LDAP with a bind account and password

NOTE: before upgrading to HA, you will need to:
- Switch / migrate to using PostgreSQL as a database
- Migrate the `sharedStorage` and `homeStorage` to a `ReadWriteMany` (`RWX`) storage class like NFS
