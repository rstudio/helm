# This example deploys RStudio Workbench using images in a private
# container registry.
#
# Both the Workbench and session container images may be customized in
# the helm chart to pull from your own container registry instead of the
# public Posit provided images. This example also shows where to provide
# private registry credentials in the form of a Kubernetes secret of type
# kubernetes.io/dockercfg
# Note the credentials secret must be specified twice to apply to Workbench
# and the session images (shown in the example below).
#
# The focus of this example is on private container images, however there
# are a few requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for homeStorage and sharedStorage
# and a PostgreSQL database.


# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key
