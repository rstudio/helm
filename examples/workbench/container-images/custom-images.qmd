# Configuring Posit Workbench with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Workbench using custom images instead of the default public Posit provided images.

Both the Workbench service and session container images may be customized in the helm chart to pull from your own container registry instead of the public Posit provided images.

The default public images are on Docker Hub:

Workbench service: [rstudio/rstudio-workbench](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-workbench)
Workbench sessions: [rstudio/r-session-complete](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/r-session-complete)


{{< include ../_prereqs.qmd >}}

```{.yaml include="rstudio-workbench-custom-image.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```
