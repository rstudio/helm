The examples in this directory provide a starting point for deploying Posit Workbench in different configurations.
Each example has a beginning description and a series of `TODO` comments.

Before using an example, read through all the comments and ensure you address each `TODO`.

While each example focuses on one or more particular configurations, RStudio Workbench has some standard requirements listed in each example. 

Each example will need the following to run correctly:

- PostgreSQL database specified in the Workbench configuration
- License key or file specified
- `homeStorage` configured
- `sharedStorage` configured
