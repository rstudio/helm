# This example deploys RStudio Workbench with an Ingress using the
# GKE Ingress Controller to create a GCP Application Load Balancer.
#
# This example is provided to show how to set the proper annotations to
# enabled session affinity, redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and use GCP
# Certificate Manager if desired.
# The GKE Ingress Controller has a variety of settings and modes of
# operation. Please visit the GCP documentation for more details specific
# to your use case:
# https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress
#
# The focus of this example is on GKE Ingress setup, however there are a few 
# requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for homeStorage and userStorage provisioning
# and a PostgreSQL database.

# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key
