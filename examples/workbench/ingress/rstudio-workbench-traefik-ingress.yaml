# This example deploys RStudio Workbench with an Ingress using the
# Traefik Ingress Controller.
#
# This example is provided to show how to set annotations to
# enabled session affinity and to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
# The Traefik Ingress Controller has a variety of settings 
# and modes of operation. Please visit the Traefik documentation for more details
# specific to your use case:
# https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/
#
# The focus of this example is on Traefik Ingress setup, however there are a
# few requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for homeStorage and sharedStorage
# and a PostgreSQL database.

# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key

# Configures Workbench shared storage
