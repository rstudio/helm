# This example deploys RStudio Workbench with an Ingress using the
# Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller to create a
# Azure Application Gateway load balancer.
#
# This example is provided to show how to set the proper annotations to
# enabled session affinity and to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
# The Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller has a variety of settings 
# and modes of operation. Please visit the Azure documentation for more details
# specific to your use case:
# https://azure.github.io/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/
#
# The focus of this example is on Azure Application Gateway Ingress setup,
# however there are a few requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for homeStorage and userStorage provisioning
# and a PostgreSQL database.

# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key
