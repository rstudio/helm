The examples in this directory provide a starting point for deploying Posit Package Manager in different configurations. 

Each example has a beginning description and a series of `TODO` comments.
Before using an example, read through all the comments and ensure you address each `TODO`.

While each example focuses on one or more particular configurations, Posit Package Manager has some standard requirements listed in each example. 

Each example will need the following to run correctly:

- PostgreSQL database specified in the Package Manager configuration
- License key or file specified
- [`sharedStorage`](https://docs.posit.co/rspm/admin/getting-started/installation/installation-kubernetes/#using-shared-storage) or [`S3Storage`](https://docs.posit.co/rspm/admin/getting-started/installation/installation-kubernetes/#using-aws-s3-with-eks) configured
