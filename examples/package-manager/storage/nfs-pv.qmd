# Configuring Posit Package Manager with an NFS-backed `PersistentVolume`

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with a single `PersistentVolume` backed by an NFS server.

The `PersistentVolume` allows setting NFS `mountOptions` and it creates a `StorageClass` that Posit Package Manager then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup) due to the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain` setting.
