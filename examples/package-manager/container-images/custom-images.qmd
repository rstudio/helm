# Configuring Posit Package Manager with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Package Manager using a custom image instead of the default public Posit provided image.

The Package Manager image may be customized in the helm chart to pull from your own container registry instead of the public Posit provided images.

The default public images are on Docker Hub:

Package Manager: [rstudio/rstudio-package-manager](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-package-manager)

{{< include ../_prereqs.qmd >}}

```{.yaml include="rstudio-pm-custom-image.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```
