# Configuring Posit Package Manager with NGINX Ingress

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with an Ingress using the Ingress NGINX Controller.

The Ingress NGINX Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation.
[Please visit the NGINX controller documentation for more details specific to your use case:](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)

::: callout-note
This example is for the Ingress NGINX Controller which is part of Kubernetes. 
If you are using the NGINX or NGINX Plus Ingress Controllers from NGINX Inc located at https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress then different annotations will need to be applied.
