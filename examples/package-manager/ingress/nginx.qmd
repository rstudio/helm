# Configuring Posit Package Manager with a NGINX Ingress

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with an Ingress using the Ingress NGINX Controller.

The Ingress NGINX Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation. Please visit the [NGINX controller documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) for more details specific to your use case.

::: callout-note
This example is for the Ingress NGINX Controller which is part of Kubernetes and is located at [https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx). If you are using the NGINX or NGINX Plus Ingress Controllers from NGINX Inc located at [https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress) then different annotations will need to be applied.
