#### _Helm library helpers for use by official RStudio charts_

## For Production

To ensure a stable production deployment, please:

* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. **IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes**
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Pay close attention to [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

# Usage

> The `rstudio-library` chart _cannot be installed_

A ["library" chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/) exists to provide helper functions for use by other
helm charts.

The functions and helpers defined in the `rstudio-library` chart are utilized by the other RStudio Helm charts.

It cannot be used directly.

If you are curious about its usage, take a look at the other charts (i.e. `rstudio-connect`, etc.) and look
for `rstudio-library` in the `templates/` directory.
