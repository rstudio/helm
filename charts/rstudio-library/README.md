#### _Helm library helpers for use by official RStudio charts_

## For production

To ensure a stable production deployment:

* "Pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do this using the:
  * `helm dependency` command *and* the associated "Chart.lock" files *or*
  * the `--version` flag.
 
    ::: {.callout-important}
    This protects you from breaking changes.
    :::

* Before upgrading check for breaking changes using `helm-diff` plugin and `helm diff upgrade`.
* Read [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking changes and the documentation below on how to use the chart.

# Usage

> The `rstudio-library` chart _cannot be installed_

A ["library" chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/) exists to provide helper functions for use by other
helm charts.

The functions and helpers defined in the `rstudio-library` chart are utilized by the other RStudio Helm charts.

It cannot be used directly.

If you are curious about its usage, take a look at the other charts (i.e. `rstudio-connect`, etc.) and look
for `rstudio-library` in the `templates/` directory.
