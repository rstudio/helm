  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes

  for breaking changes

# Usage

> The `rstudio-library` chart _cannot be installed_

A ["library" chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/) exists to provide helper functions for use by other
helm charts.

The functions and helpers defined in the `rstudio-library` chart are utilized by the other RStudio Helm charts.

It cannot be used directly.

If you are curious about its usage, take a look at the other charts (i.e. `rstudio-connect`, etc.) and look
for `rstudio-library` in the `templates/` directory.
