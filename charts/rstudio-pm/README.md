# Posit Package Manager

![Version: 0.5.22](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.5.22-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 2023.12.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-2023.12.0-informational?style=flat-square)

#### _Official Helm chart for RStudio Package Manager_

IT Administrators use [Posit Package Manager](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/package-manager/) to control and manage
R and Python packages that Data Scientists need to create and share data products.

## For Production

To ensure a stable production deployment, please:

* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. **IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes**
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Pay close attention to [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` at version 0.5.22:

```bash
helm repo add rstudio https://helm.rstudio.com
helm upgrade --install my-release rstudio/rstudio-pm --version=0.5.22
```

To explore other chart versions, take a look at:
```
helm search repo rstudio/rstudio-pm -l
```

## Upgrade Guidance

### 0.4.0

- When upgrading to version 0.4.0 or later, the Package Manager service moves from running as `root` to running as
  the `rstudio-pm` user (with `uid:gid` `999:999`). A `chown` of persistent storage may be required. We will try to
  fix this up automatically. Set `enableMigrations=false` to disable the automatic fixup / hook.

## Required Configuration

This chart requires the following in order to function:

* A license file, license key, or address of a running license server. See the [Licensing](#licensing) section below for more details.
* A Kubernetes [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) that contains the data directory for RSPM.
  * If `sharedStorage.create` is set, a PVC that relies on the default storage class will be created to generate the PersistentVolume.
    Most Kubernetes environments do not have a default storage class that you can use with `ReadWriteMany` access mode out-of-the-box.
    In this case, we recommend you disable `sharedStorage.create` and create your own `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`, then
    mount them into the container by specifying the `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts` parameters, or by specifying your `PersistentVolumeClaim` using `sharedStorage.name` and `sharedStorage.mount`.
  * If you cannot use a `PersistentVolume` to properly mount your data directory, you'll need to mount your data in the container
    by using a regular [Kubernetes Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes), specified in `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts`.
  * Alternatively, S3 storage can be used. See the [S3 Configuration](#s3-configuration) section for details.

## Licensing

This chart supports activating the product using a license file, license key, or license server. In the case of a license file or key, we recommend against placing it in your values file directly.

### License File

We recommend storing a license file as a `Secret` and setting the `license.file.secret` and `license.file.secretKey` values accordingly.

First, create the secret declaratively with YAML or imperatively using the following command:

`kubectl create secret generic rstudio-pm-license --from-file=licenses/rstudio-pm.lic`

Second, specify the following values:

```yaml
license:
  file:
    secret: rstudio-pm-license
    secretKey: rstudio-pm.lic
```

Alternatively, license files can be set during `helm install` with the following argument:

`--set-file license.file.contents=licenses/rstudio-pm.lic`

### License Key

Set a license key directly in your values file (`license.key`) or during `helm install` with the argument `--set license.key=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`.

### License Server

Set a license server directly in your values file (`license.server`) or during `helm install` with the argument `--set license.server=<LICENSE_SERVER_HOST_ADDRESS>`.

## S3 Configuration

Package Manager [can be configured to store its data in S3
buckets](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/files-directories/#data-destinations),
which eliminates the need to provision shared storage for multiple replicas. A
`values.yaml` file using S3 might contain something like the following:

``` yaml
config:
  Storage:
    Default: s3
  S3Storage:
    Bucket: your-s3-bucket
```

If you are running on EKS, we strongly suggest using [IAM Roles for Service
Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
to manage the credentials needed to access S3. In this scenario, once you have
[created an IAM
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-service-account-iam-policy-and-role.html),
you can use this role as an annotation on the existing Service Account:

``` yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789000:role/iam-role-name-here
```

If you are unable to use IAM Roles for Service Accounts, there are any number of
alternatives for injecting AWS credentials into a container. As a fallback, the
chart supports setting static credentials:

``` yaml
awsAccessKeyId: your-access-key-id
awsSecretAccessKey: your-secret-access-key
```

Bear in mind that static, long-lived credentials are the least secure option and
should be avoided if at all possible.

## General Principles

- In most places, we opt to pass helm values over configmaps. We translate these into the valid `.gcfg` file format
required by rstudio-pm.

## Configuration File

The configuration values all take the form of usual helm values
so you can set the database password with something like:

```
... --set config.Postgres.Password=mypassword ...
```

The Helm `config` values are converted into the `rstudio-pm.gcfg` service configuration file via go-templating.
