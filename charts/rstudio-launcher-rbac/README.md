#### _RBAC definition for the RStudio Job Launcher_

## For Production

To ensure a stable production deployment, please:

* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. **IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes**
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Pay close attention to [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` at version 0.2.16:

```bash
helm repo add rstudio https://helm.rstudio.com
helm upgrade --install my-release rstudio/rstudio-launcher-rbac --version=0.2.16
```

To explore other chart versions, take a look at:
```
helm search repo rstudio/rstudio-launcher-rbac -l
```

## Common Usage

> NOTE: this chart is intended primarily for use by individuals who _do not_
> want to use our other Helm charts. This chart ONLY deploys RBAC or generates RBAC yaml directly
>
> It is _not needed_ if you are using other RStudio Helm charts

To generate RBAC yaml for use with `kubectl apply`:
```
helm template -n rstudio rstudio-launcher-rbac rstudio/rstudio-launcher-rbac
```

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| clusterRoleCreate | bool | `false` | Whether to create the ClusterRole that grants access to the Kubernetes nodes API. This is used by the Launcher to get all of the IP addresses associated with the node that is running a particular job. In most cases, this can be disabled as the node's internal address is sufficient to allow proper functionality. |
| fullnameOverride | string | `""` | The override for the "FullName" which defaults to "ReleaseName-ChartName" or "ReleaseName" (if "ReleaseName" contains "ChartName") |
| includeReleaseNamespace | bool | `true` | Whether the helm release namespace should be a possible launcher target |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | The override for "ChartName" in the "FullName" which defaults to "ReleaseName-ChartName" or "ReleaseName" (if "ReleaseName" contains "ChartName") |
| removeNamespaceReferences | bool | `false` | remove explicit namespace references (problematic if targetNamespaces is defined) |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` |  |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` |  |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` |  |
| targetNamespaces | list | `[]` | The targetNamespaces that the launcher will be able to launch sessions into |
